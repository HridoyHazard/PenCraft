      "New software enables blind and low-vision users to create interactive",
    summary:
      "A growing number of tools enable users to make online data representations, like charts, that are accessible for people who are blind or have low vision. However, most tools require an existing visual chart that can then be converted into an accessible format.",
    content:
      "This creates barriers that prevent blind and low-vision users from building their own custom data representations, and it can limit their ability to explore and analyze important information.A team of researchers from MIT and University College London (UCL) wants to change the way people think about accessible data representations.They created a software system called Umwelt (which means environment in German) that can enable blind and low-vision users to build customized, multimodal data representations without needing an initial visual chart.Umwelt, an authoring environment designed for screen-reader users, incorporates an editor that allows someone to upload a dataset and create a customized representation, such as a scatterplot, that can include three modalities: visualization, textual description, and sonification. Sonification involves converting data into nonspeech audio.",

    summary:
      "Through reforestation and other techniques, Pure Earth restores degraded mining concessions to reduce legacy mercury contamination.",
    content:
      "Since 2019, Pure Earth has worked with AMATAF, an association of artisanal and small-scale gold miners in Madre de Dios, Peru, to counter worsening conditions in the rainforest due to destructive gold mining practices. With the help of miners, Pure Earth experts and partners have been able to carry out innovative research on the conditions of mined-out Amazonian land, and design methods that encourage life on damaged land.The miners are doing their part to ensure the sustainability of reforestation efforts by learning how to make and apply soil amendments to enrich nutrient-poor soil, and providing continued care for the saplings they have planted.",

      "New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge was booed by New York fans on his bobblehead day after he struck out for the fourth time in Saturday's 2-0, 10-inning loss to the Tampa Bay Rays.I've heard worse and I'd probably be doing the same thing in their situation, Judge said after his 10th career game with four or more strikeouts.Judge is hitting .179 with three homers, 11 RBIs and a team-high 27 strikeouts.It's still early, Judge said. It's a long season but just missing the pitch. If I get a pitch in the zone, I got to capitalize on it because I don't get many and usually that what's it comes down – don't miss your pitch when you get it – and take your walks when you're not getting anything.",

This compares with global air passenger volumes, which are only likely to exceed pre-pandemic levels this year, according to trade group Airports Council International.Istanbul airport was the busiest in the Europe region in terms of flight numbers last year, according to data firm OAG, while Turkish Airlines was the third-busiest airline, behind Ryanair and easyJet.The rapid expansion of Turkey’s aviation sector compared with rivals has led the country to become a dominant player in the European market. The growth comes as the country’s airlines and airports have invested in upgraded infrastructure and fleets, and were quick to bring back capacity following the pandemic. Turkey’s buoyant tourism industry has also provided a boost.",
